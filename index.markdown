# Kia ora,

I am currently a research assistant at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html), New Zealand, working alongside researchers from the [Auckland Bioengineering Institute](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/abi.html) and the [Geothermal Institute](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/engineering/our-research/discover/research-areas-and-facilities/geothermal-institute.html). I am interested in the development and application of efficient uncertainty quantification techniques for large-scale inverse problems governed by partial differential equations.

I have a master's degree in engineering science from the University of Auckland. My thesis investigated the application of ensemble Kalman methods to inverse problems and optimal experimental design problems arising in geothermal reservoir engineering. Prior to this, I received a bachelor's degree (also in engineering science) with a focus on statistical learning and optimisation techniques.
