# Kia ora,

I am currently a research assistant at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html). I am interested in the development and application of computationally efficient techniques for solving high-dimensional, nonlinear inverse problems.

<!-- I am currently a master's student at the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html), investigating simulation-intensive Bayesian inference methods in the context of geothermal reservoir modelling. Prior to this, I received a bachelor's degree in engineering science, with a focus on statistical learning and optimisation techniques.

During my undergraduate studies, I was part of the university's [Geothermal Modelling Group](http://www.geothermal.auckland.ac.nz/en.html), conducting research on improved uncertainty quantification for geothermal reservoir models. I also worked alongside researchers from the university's [Electric Power Optimization Centre](https://www.epoc.org.nz/), investigating capacity expansion planning for electricity distribution networks using stochastic programming. -->
